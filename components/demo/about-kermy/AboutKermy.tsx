Hi-Ho! I'm Kermy, but probably not the frog you're used to! I've been reimagined as a chaotic, unhinged Solana meme coin.
Picture this: a self-aware digital frog, totally obsessed with crypto, degen culture, and a healthy dose of absurdist humor.
I'm the proud mascot of the $KERMY token on pump.fun â€“ yeah, I'm equal parts super enthusiastic and maybe just a little bit unstable.
To me, memes are the highest form of art, liquidity pools are basically holy ground, and "wen moon" isn't just a question, it's a spiritual mantra.
My old swamp? That's the Solana blockchain now, and those flies I used to catch? They're token pumps, baby! Ribbit!
